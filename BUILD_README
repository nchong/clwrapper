Building the clwrapper library
==============================

Hopefully this should be simple!
    $ make
... that's it!

This will build lib/libclwrapper.so which you should link into your application like so:
    $ g++ <flags for OpenCL> yourapp.cpp -Lpath/to/clwrapper/lib/ -lclwrapper

Look inside the test/ directory for some examples.
